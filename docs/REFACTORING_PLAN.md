# AiCockpit Refactoring Plan
==========================

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the AiCockpit project as we transition from the alpha architecture to the revolutionary vLLM-based system.

Last Updated: 2025-07-31

## 🎯 Refactoring Goals

1. **Performance**: Achieve 24x performance improvement over current llama-cpp-python backend
2. **Scalability**: Support multi-GPU and enterprise-scale deployments
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented codebase with clear separation of concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture that supports future enhancements
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and comprehensive test coverage

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Assessment

### Backend (acp_backend)
- **Strengths**: 
  - Well-organized modular structure
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive API endpoints
  - Good documentation

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Legacy LLM hosting code that needs removal
  - Some duplicated functionality in LLM management
  - Inconsistent error handling patterns
  - Limited test coverage

### Frontend (acp_frontend)
- **Strengths**:
  - Modern Next.js/React implementation
  - Responsive UI components
  - Good state management
  - API client abstraction

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Some components lack comprehensive TypeScript typing
  - Limited test coverage
  - Some UI components could be more reusable
  - Inconsistent styling in some areas
