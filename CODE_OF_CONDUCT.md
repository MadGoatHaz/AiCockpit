# AiCockpit Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

AiCockpit is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone. We expect all participants in the AiCockpit community (including contributors, users, and leaders) to interact respectfully and professionally.

## Expected Behavior

*   Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards others.
*   Focus on constructive collaboration.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Any form of harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Offensive comments related to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity/expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
*   Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
*   Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all AiCockpit community spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, issue trackers, communication channels) and when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Zero-Tolerance Enforcement

**This Code of Conduct serves as the sole and final warning.**

Participation in the AiCockpit community is a privilege, not a right. We operate under a **zero-tolerance policy** for any behavior deemed unacceptable by the project leaders.

Any individual found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct may be subject to **immediate and permanent expulsion** from all AiCockpit community spaces and platforms, without prior notice or discussion. This may include, but is not limited to:

*   Blocking access to GitHub repositories and other project resources.
*   Removal from any communication channels.

Project leaders reserve the absolute right to make these determinations and enforce these consequences at their sole discretion.

For severe violations, or if illegal activities are suspected, project leaders may also report the behavior and individuals involved to relevant platform administrators (e.g., GitHub Support) or appropriate legal authorities.
