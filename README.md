## 👋 Welcome to AiCockpit!

**AiCockpit (ACP)** is an ambitious open-source project to create a locally hosted backend API and, ultimately, a full-fledged web application. Imagine a powerful, private workspace, running on your own hardware, where you can seamlessly manage Large Language Models (LLMs), orchestrate AI agents, and organize your projects with AI assistance.

Our vision extends far beyond creating a simple alternative to cloud-based AI tools. We aim to build **THE definitive, self-hosted, DIY Ai workspace for everyone.** AiCockpit is designed to be easily installable, accessible on your local network (or via your own VPN for secure remote access), ensuring your data remains entirely within your control, on your hardware. 

While prioritizing local AI and data sovereignty, AiCockpit will also embrace a **hybrid approach**, enabling you to seamlessly integrate and manage cloud-based AI services alongside your local models. This allows for a powerful collaborative environment where different AI capabilities (local and remote) can contribute to various aspects of your projects.

The ultimate aspiration for AiCockpit is to evolve into a **comprehensive, collaborative Ai work environment that verges on being an operating system in itself.** We envision a future where you can interact with AiCockpit not just through typing, but through **voice commands** and other intuitive modalities, unlocking new levels of productivity and creative partnership with AI. It's about building a foundational platform for human-AI collaboration on *any* conceivable project.

**Current Version:** 0.2.0-alpha (Backend Stable, Frontend Development Starting)
**Last Updated:** May 28, 2024

## 🌟 Core Vision

AiCockpit is not just another AI tool; it's envisioned as **the ultimate self-hosted, AI-powered command center for boundless creativity and productivity.** We aim to build a deeply integrated workspace where humans and AI collaborate seamlessly on *any* project imaginable.

**AiCockpit aspires to empower you to:**

*   🧠 **Master Your LLMs:** Effortlessly discover, download, manage, and interact with a diverse range of local Large Language Models (GGUF focus, with an eye towards future formats and integrations). Go beyond simple chat to fine-tune, experiment, and truly own your AI interactions.
*   🤖 **Orchestrate Intelligent Agents:** Define, configure, and deploy sophisticated AI agents (powered by frameworks like `smolagents` and beyond). Equip them with tools to automate complex workflows, conduct research, manage tasks, and act as specialized assistants for your projects.
*   💻 **Supercharge Code Development:** From initial scaffolding and boilerplate generation to advanced debugging, code explanation, refactoring, and automated testing, AiCockpit will be an indispensable co-pilot for software engineers.
*   🎨 **Unleash Creative Media Generation:** Extend beyond text and code. Imagine AiCockpit facilitating image generation, audio synthesis, video assistance, and other multimedia creation tasks by integrating with relevant models and tools, all managed within your local cockpit.
*   ✍️ **Elevate Content Creation:** Whether you're drafting articles, writing scripts, brainstorming ideas, or translating languages, AiCockpit will provide a rich environment for AI-assisted writing and content development.
*   🔬 **Drive Research & Analysis:** Utilize AI for data analysis, information retrieval, summarization of complex documents, and accelerating your research endeavors across any domain.
*   🛠️ **Build *Your* Perfect AI Workspace:** The core principle is **extensibility and customization**. If AiCockpit doesn't have a tool or integration you need, it will be designed to let you build it or plug it in. We envision a rich ecosystem of user-created plugins and extensions.
*   🗂️ **Achieve Total Project Organization:** Manage distinct work sessions, each with its own dedicated file system ("Work Board"), context, and persistent AI memory. Keep your diverse projects, from a software library to a novel, perfectly organized and AI-supercharged.
*   🌐 **Own Your Data, Own Your AI:** By being self-hosted, you maintain full control over your data, your models, and your AI interactions, ensuring privacy and security.
*   🔥 **Foster Open Innovation:** Built with Python, FastAPI, and a modular architecture, AiCockpit is designed for community contributions. The ultimate dream? AiCockpit becoming so advanced it actively assists in its own development and helps users build the future of AI collaboration!

**In short: If you can dream of a project you can do with an AI, AiCockpit aims to be the self-hosted platform that helps you build it, manage it, and take it to the next level.**

## ✨ Key Features (Backend - Solid & Ready!)

The AiCockpit backend provides a robust set of APIs for:

*   🔮 **LLM Management:**
    *   Discover available GGUF models.
    *   Load/unload models (via `llama-cpp-python`).
    *   Stream chat completions using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
*   🧑‍✈️ **AI Agent Orchestration:**
    *   Define global and session-specific agent configurations.
    *   Execute agents (current `smolagents` integration is a functional placeholder, ripe for full implementation!).
    *   Stream agent outputs via SSE.
*   🗂️ **Work Session Management:**
    *   Create, list, update, and delete distinct work sessions.
    *   Each session has its own isolated data storage.
*   📋 **Work Board (File System Access):**
    *   Manage files and directories within each session (list, read, write, delete, move, create directory).
*   ⚙️ **System & Configuration:**
    *   Endpoints for system health, status, and viewing configurations.
*   🛡️ **Stability & Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate (as of the last major refactor).
    *   Robust dependency injection for modularity.
