# AiCockpit: Containerized AI-Collaborative Development Platform

## **The Complete AI-Collaborative Development Solution**

**Where containerized workspaces meet external AI services for seamless development**

Welcome to AiCockpit! This platform provides containerized development environments with seamless integration with external AI services. Our mission is to transform how developers work with AI by providing reliable, easy-to-use tools that enhance productivity without the complexity of self-hosted models.

**Our Philosophy:** *"If you don't care about your tools, then you don't care about the result. Making good tools are the best tools - take pride and time to maintain them as they do the same for you."* This project embodies a partnership between human creativity and AI-driven precision, providing developers with powerful tools for modern software development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting started with AiCockpit's containerized development platform:

### **Quick Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MadGoatHaz/AiCockpit.git
cd AiCockpit

# Set up Python environment (recommended)
python -m venv aicockpit-env
source aicockpit-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: aicockpit-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up external AI services
python scripts/setup_external_ai.py

# Start the backend (FastAPI)
cd acp_backend
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In a new terminal, start the frontend (Next.js)
cd acp_frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Using Containerized Workspaces**

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system
2. Start the backend and frontend as described above
3. Navigate to the "Workspaces" section in the web interface
4. Create a new workspace with your preferred development environment
5. Launch the IDE for your workspace

See the [Workspace User Guide](docs/WORKSPACE_USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### **Configuring External AI Services**

1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_external_ai.py
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your services

3. Start the backend and frontend as described in the Quick Start Guide

4. In the web interface, go to "AI Config" panel to manage your services
