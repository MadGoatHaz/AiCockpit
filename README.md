# AiCockpit 2025 üöÅ
## **The Revolutionary AI-Collaborative Development Platform**

**Where VS Code becomes the "IDE hand" of your AI collaborator**

Welcome to AiCockpit! This revolutionary platform is born from a collaborative spirit and a passion for redefining human-AI partnership in software development. Our mission is to transform how developers work with AI, making advanced AI collaboration not just possible, but seamless, intuitive, and profoundly powerful.

**Our Philosophy:** *"If you don't care about your tools, then you don't care about the result. Making good tools are the best tools - take pride and time to maintain them as they do the same for you."* This project is a testament to a partnership between human creativity and AI-driven precision, where VS Code becomes the physical manifestation of AI collaboration.

### **A Project's Revolutionary Journey**
This project is undergoing a profound transformation, guided by the vision document **"AiCockpit- vLLM Integration and VS Code.txt"**. We're not just building another AI tool - we're creating the future of human-AI collaborative development. To understand our revolutionary vision, read the [Project Vision 2025](docs/PROJECT_VISION_2025.md).

### **Containerized Development Environments**
AiCockpit now features containerized development environments that you can launch instantly. Each workspace runs in an isolated Docker container with its own file system and terminal access. See the [Workspace User Guide](docs/WORKSPACE_USER_GUIDE.md) for more information.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Getting started with AiCockpit's revolutionary AI-collaborative development platform:

### **Phase 1: Current Architecture (Alpha)**
While we're restructuring for the vLLM + VS Code revolution, you can explore the current alpha version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AiCockpit.git
cd AiCockpit

# Check project health
python scripts/project_health_check.py --format json

# Start the current backend (FastAPI)
cd acp_backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Start the frontend (Next.js)
cd acp_frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Phase 2: Containerized Workspaces**
AiCockpit now features containerized development environments. To use this feature:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system
2. Start the backend and frontend as described above
3. Navigate to the "Workspaces" section in the web interface
4. Create a new workspace with your preferred development environment
5. Launch the IDE for your workspace

See the [Workspace User Guide](docs/WORKSPACE_USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### **Phase 1: Current Architecture (Alpha)**
While we're restructuring for the vLLM + VS Code revolution, you can explore the current alpha version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MadGoatHaz/AiCockpit.git
cd AiCockpit

# Set up Python environment (recommended)
python -m venv aicockpit-env
source aicockpit-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: aicockpit-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
