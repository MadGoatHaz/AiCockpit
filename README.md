## 👋 Welcome to AiCockpit!

**AiCockpit (ACP)** is an ambitious open-source project to create a locally hosted backend API and, ultimately, a full-fledged web application. Imagine a powerful, private workspace, running on your own hardware, where you can seamlessly manage Large Language Models (LLMs), orchestrate AI agents, and organize your projects with AI assistance.

Our goal is to build something like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, but **self-hosted, highly customizable, and focused on empowering developers and creators on their local machines** (initially targeting Linux/Ubuntu).

**Current Version:** 0.2.0-alpha (Backend Stable, Frontend Development Starting)
**Last Updated:** May 28, 2024

---

## 🌟 Core Vision

AiCockpit aspires to be:

*   🧠 **An LLM Hub:** Easily discover, download, load, and chat with various GGUF-compatible models running locally.
*   🤖 **An Agent Orchestrator:** Define, configure, and run AI agents (powered by frameworks like `smolagents`) for complex task automation.
*   🛠️ **A Developer's Co-pilot:** Integrate AI deeply into your development workflow, from code generation to debugging and documentation.
*    organizar **An Organized Workspace:** Manage distinct work sessions, each with its own file system ("Work Board") and context, keeping your projects tidy and your AI interactions persistent.
*   🌐 **A Collaborative Platform (Eventually):** While starting local-first, we envision a future where you can securely share and collaborate within your AiCockpit instance.
*   🔥 **Open & Extensible:** Built with Python, FastAPI, and a modular architecture, AiCockpit is designed for community contributions and easy extension. We aim for AiCockpit to eventually become smart enough to help with its own development!

---

## ✨ Key Features (Backend - Solid & Ready!)

The AiCockpit backend provides a robust set of APIs for:

*   🔮 **LLM Management:**
    *   Discover available GGUF models.
    *   Load/unload models (via `llama-cpp-python`).
    *   Stream chat completions using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
*   🧑‍✈️ **AI Agent Orchestration:**
    *   Define global and session-specific agent configurations.
    *   Execute agents (current `smolagents` integration is a functional placeholder, ripe for full implementation!).
    *   Stream agent outputs via SSE.
*   🗂️ **Work Session Management:**
    *   Create, list, update, and delete distinct work sessions.
    *   Each session has its own isolated data storage.
*   📋 **Work Board (File System Access):**
    *   Manage files and directories within each session (list, read, write, delete, move, create directory).
*   ⚙️ **System & Configuration:**
    *   Endpoints for system health, status, and viewing configurations.
*   🛡️ **Stability & Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate (as of the last major refactor).
    *   Robust dependency injection for modularity.

## 🎨 Sneak Peek (Coming Soon!)

We're hard at work designing an intuitive and powerful interface for AiCockpit. Imagine a clean dashboard to manage your LLMs, a flexible canvas to organize your project files, and seamless interaction with your AI agents.

<!-- 
  Future AiCockpit UI Mockup Placeholder:
  --------------------------------------
  | [LLM Management] [Agent Config]    |
  |------------------------------------|
  | [File Explorer/Canvas Area]        |
  |  - project_alpha/                  |
  |    - main.py                       |
  |    - data_analysis.ipynb           |
  |  - research_papers/                |
  |------------------------------------|
  | [Chat Interface / Output Log]      |
  |  > User: Analyze this data...      |
  |  < AI: Processing...               |
  --------------------------------------

  We envision a multi-pane layout: 
  - Top: Controls for LLM selection, agent configuration, session management.
  - Left/Main: A dynamic "canvas" or file explorer for the current work session.
  - Bottom/Side: An interactive chat/log area for LLM communication and agent output.

  ✨ UI/UX designers and frontend developers, we'd love your input and mockups! ✨

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Current Focus

Our backend is stable and feature-rich. The **immediate high priority is building the Frontend Web Interface!**

**Key Milestones Ahead:**

1.  🌟 **Frontend Development (Phase 1 - Core UI):**
    *   Select a modern web framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
    *   Develop API client for seamless backend communication (including SSE).
    *   Build core UI components for:
        *   LLM Management (list, load/unload, status).
        *   Agent Configuration (create, view, edit global/session agents).
        *   Agent Execution (select agent, input prompts, stream outputs).
        *   Work Session Management (create, list, select, delete).
        *   "Canvas" File Explorer (browse session files via WorkBoard API).
        *   Basic Chat Interface for LLMs.
2.  🤖 **Backend Enhancements:**
