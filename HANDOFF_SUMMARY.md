# AiCockpit Development Handoff Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of the AiCockpit project for the next contributor. The project has been significantly enhanced with containerized development environments and a web-based IDE interface.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Containerized Development Environments
- Docker-based container management for isolated development environments
- Support for multiple development stacks (Python, Node.js, Go, Java, Anaconda)
- Workspace lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete)
- Resource optimization for containerized environments

### 2. Web-Based IDE
- Complete IDE interface with file browser, code editor, and terminal
- Workspace dashboard for managing multiple development environments
- Workspace launcher component for easy access to IDE
- Integrated navigation between workspaces

### 3. External AI Service Integration
- Support for LM Studio, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and custom services
- API client with methods for managing external AI services
- Service testing and activation features
- Configuration UI for managing AI services

## Codebase Structure

### Backend (acp_backend)
- Container management modules for Docker integration
- Workspace provisioning system
- Extended API endpoints for workspace management
- Terminal service for container access
- External AI service management

### Frontend (acp_frontend)
- Workspace dashboard UI with create/start/stop/delete functionality
- IDE components (file browser, code editor, terminal)
- Workspace navigation integration
- API client with TypeScript interfaces

## Key Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to reflect the current implementation:

1. **README.md**: Updated with containerized workspace features and setup instructions
2. **ACP Handoffdoc.txt**: Comprehensive update about the containerized web-based IDE implementation
3. **docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md**: Current implementation status and future plans
4. **docs/CONTAINERIZED_IDE_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Implementation status for all phases
5. **docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md**: Updated refactoring priorities
6. **docs/WORKSPACE_USER_GUIDE.md**: Enhanced with external AI service information

## API Client Enhancements

The TypeScript API client (`acp_frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts`) has been improved with:
- Better documentation for existing endpoints
- New interfaces for workspace management
- Workspace management methods in the ApiClient class

## Next Steps for Development

1. **vLLM Integration**: Replace llama-cpp-python with high-performance vLLM backend
2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Connect UI components to API client
3. **VS Code Extension**: Scaffold the AI's "IDE hand" extension
4. **Agent Framework**: Evaluate Google ADK vs current smol-dev implementation
5. **AI System Access**: Direct AI access to containerized environments
6. **Advanced Workspace Features**: Persistent storage, sharing, and collaboration
7. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve <100ms latency target
8. **Kubernetes Support**: Add Kubernetes orchestration for enterprise deployments

## Getting Started

To continue development:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MadGoatHaz/AiCockpit.git`
2. Set up the Python environment: `python -m venv aicockpit-env && source aicockpit-env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up external AI services: `python scripts/setup_external_ai.py`
5. Start the backend: `cd acp_backend && uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
6. Start the frontend: `cd acp_frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
7. Ensure Docker is running for workspace functionality

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- Basic workspace creation and management
- Terminal access to containers
- File system operations within workspaces
- Web-based IDE functionality
- External AI service integration

Performance and security testing are still pending.
