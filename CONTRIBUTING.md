First off, thank you for considering contributing to AiCockpit! It's people like you that make open source such a great community. We're excited to see what you bring to the project.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to AiCockpit, from writing code and documentation to reporting bugs and suggesting features.

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. When reporting a bug, please include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.

### Suggesting Enhancements or Features

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub. Describe your idea clearly, why it would be beneficial, and any potential implementation details you've considered.

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions! Here's how to get started:

1.  **Find an Issue:** Look for open issues tagged with `help wanted` or `good first issue`, or discuss your intended contribution by opening a new issue.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the AiCockpit repository.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your feature or bugfix (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/bug-description`).
4.  **Develop:** Make your changes, adhering to the project's coding style (see below).
5.  **Test:**
    *   Write new tests for any new functionality you add.
    *   Ensure all tests pass by running `pdm run test`.
6.  **Format & Lint:** Ensure your code is formatted and linted correctly by running `pdm run format` and `pdm run lint`.
7.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
8.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
9.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the `MadGoatHaz/AiCockpit` repository.
    *   Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.
    *   Link the PR to any relevant issues.

### Code Style

*   We use `Black` for code formatting and `Ruff` for linting. Please run these tools before committing.
*   Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
*   Write clear, concise, and well-commented code where necessary (avoid obvious comments).

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial. If you're adding a feature, please update relevant documentation or add new documentation as needed. This includes inline code comments, docstrings, and updates to the `README.md` or other documentation files.

## UI/UX Contributions

As we are actively developing the frontend, contributions in UI/UX design, mockups, and frontend development are highly encouraged and valued! If you have ideas or mockups for what AiCockpit could look like, please share them by opening an issue or a discussion thread.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Please refer to the "Getting Started (Developers)" section in the `README.md`.

## Any Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or reach out (once we establish community channels).
